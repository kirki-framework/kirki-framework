The `priority` argument is an `integer` allowing you to change the order of your controls.

Defaults to `10`.

* When used in controls, you can use the `priority` argument to define and change the order in which your controls will be presented inside a section.
* When used for sections & panels, `priority` lets you define the order in which sections & panels are presented in the customizer.
